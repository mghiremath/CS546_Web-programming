# Web-programming

Welcome to the Github repository for my Web Programming course!

This repository contains all the course material that I have created, including lecture notes, assignments, and sample code. As a student, you are free to refer to this repository for guidance and inspiration as you work on the course assignments.

However, I would like to emphasize that this repository is not intended to be copied from. It is important that you complete the assignments and projects on your own, without relying on code or solutions from this repository. Doing so would not only violate academic integrity, but it would also deprive you of the opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer.

That being said, I hope that this repository can be a valuable resource for you as you work through the course. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

Happy learning!
